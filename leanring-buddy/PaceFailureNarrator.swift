//
//  PaceFailureNarrator.swift
//  leanring-buddy
//
//  Pure deterministic composer for plain-language failure messages
//  Pace speaks when one of the documented failure modes fires. Mirrors
//  the shape of `PaceMorningBriefBuilder` — strictly templated, no LLM
//  call, no I/O, fully unit-testable.
//
//  The CompanionManager calls into this module at four wired sites
//  (planner offline, preflight block, click all-fail, sidecar TTS
//  fallback) plus two more catch-all kinds (MCP server missing, cloud
//  bridge upstream error). The composer returns a spoken string plus
//  an optional UI hint (Settings deep-link target) so the panel can
//  surface a follow-up affordance.
//
//  See PRD `docs/prds/trust-and-failures.md` for the full kinds list.
