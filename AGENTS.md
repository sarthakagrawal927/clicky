## Overview

macOS menu bar companion app. Lives entirely in the macOS status bar (no dock icon, no main window). Clicking the menu bar icon opens a custom floating panel with companion voice controls. Uses push-to-talk (ctrl+option) to capture voice input, transcribes it on-device via Apple's `SFSpeechRecognizer`, optionally analyses the cursor screen with a local VLM (LM Studio), and sends the transcript + element map to a local reasoner (LM Studio). The planner streams a response with optional `[POINT:...]` / `[CLICK:...]` / `[TYPE:...]` tags; spoken text is played via `AVSpeechSynthesizer` and actions are posted via CGEvent.

**Fully on-device.** No cloud LLM, no cloud STT, no cloud TTS, no Cloudflare Worker call paths. Every byte stays on the user's Mac. This is the product's headline differentiator — speed + zero operating cost — and the architecture is built to protect it.

## Architecture

- **App Type**: Menu bar-only (`LSUIElement=true`), no dock icon or main window
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (macOS native) with AppKit bridging for menu bar panel and cursor overlay
- **Pattern**: MVVM with `@StateObject` / `@Published` state management
- **Planner**: local OpenAI-compatible reasoner via LM Studio (`qwen/qwen3-14b` dense default — ~9 GB at Q4, fastest config with `--num-parallel 1`). `<think>…</think>` blocks stripped before TTS and action-tag parsing. No cloud LLM.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Apple **`SFSpeechRecognizer`** (on-device, `requiresOnDeviceRecognition=true`) by default — instant, no model download. **WhisperKit** (CoreML/ANE) is the only other option, opt-in via `VoiceTranscriptionProvider=whisperkit`. All cloud STT providers have been removed.
- **Text-to-Speech**: On-device **`AVSpeechSynthesizer`** via `LocalTTSClient` — the only `BuddyTTSClient` conformer. Auto-prefers Premium > Enhanced > Default English voices. Cloud TTS has been removed.
- **Local Vision-Language Model (optional)**: LM Studio at `http://localhost:1234/v1` (OpenAI-compatible). When `UseLocalVLMForScreenContext=true`, the cursor-screen screenshot is sent to the local VLM (Qwen3-VL-8B by default) and its structured element map is prepended to the planner prompt. Wraps the existing cloud path — falls back silently on error. **VLM-skip heuristic** in `PaceTagParsers.transcriptIsLikelyScreenReferential` bypasses the call for pure-Q&A transcripts; override via `AlwaysRunLocalVLMRegardlessOfTranscript=true`.
- **Planner (`BuddyPlannerClient`)**: only conformer today is `LocalPlannerClient` — a text-only OpenAI-compatible streaming client pointing at LM Studio. The protocol shape stays so an alternate local runtime (Ollama, raw llama.cpp, MLX-server) can plug in via a new conformer. No cloud Claude.
- **Screen Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14.2+), multi-monitor support
- **Voice Input**: Push-to-talk via `AVAudioEngine` + pluggable transcription-provider layer. System-wide keyboard shortcut via listen-only CGEvent tap.
- **Voice Input UI**: Whisper Flow-style glassmorphic capsule (`WhisperFlowVoicePillView`) with gradient-bordered audio-reactive bars; replaces the cursor while listening.
- **Cursor**: Codex-style arrow (`CodexArrowShape`) with linear-gradient fill, white highlight stroke, dual shadow.
- **Element Pointing**: the planner embeds `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its response. The overlay parses these, maps coordinates to the correct monitor, and animates the cursor along a bezier arc to the target.
- **Action Layer (agent mode)**: the planner can chain `[CLICK:x,y]`, `[DOUBLE_CLICK:x,y]`, `[TYPE:text]`, `[KEY:cmd+s]`, `[SCROLL:up:3]` tags. `PaceActionTagParser` extracts them; `PaceActionExecutor` posts events after TTS playback starts. Single-clicks try `PaceAXTargeter` first (AX-tree press), falling back to CGEvent. Gated by `EnableActions=true` in Info.plist — off by default.
- **Plan-act-observe loop**: `CompanionManager.sendTranscriptToPlannerWithScreenshot` runs a multi-step loop. Each step re-screenshots, re-invokes the VLM (heuristic permitting) and the planner, executes actions, and continues until the planner emits `[DONE]`, emits no action tags, or hits `AgentMaxSteps` (default 8).
- **Walking avatar (optional)**: `PaceAvatarOverlay` paints a small SwiftUI character at the bottom of the cursor screen in its own tiny `NSPanel`. Walks horizontally, blinks, bobs. Clicking opens the menu-bar panel. Toggleable from the panel via `isWalkingAvatarEnabled`.
- **Concurrency**: `@MainActor` isolation, async/await throughout
- **Analytics**: PostHog via `PaceAnalytics.swift`

### API Proxy (Cloudflare Worker — no Swift code reaches it anymore)

The `worker/` directory still sits in the tree but has no live callers after the cloud STT/TTS classes were deleted. It can be removed at any time without affecting the app. Left in place for historical reference only.

### Local-mode setup

See `SETUP_LOCAL.md` for the full recipe. Summary of the Info.plist switches:

| Key | Default | Effect when changed |
|---|---|---|
| `VoiceTranscriptionProvider` | `apple` | `whisperkit` — Apple `SFSpeechRecognizer` is the default (instant, on-device, zero setup); `whisperkit` swaps in CoreML/ANE Whisper. |
| `WhisperKitModel` | `openai_whisper-large-v3-v20240930_turbo` | Which Whisper variant WhisperKit downloads on first push-to-talk (only used when `VoiceTranscriptionProvider=whisperkit`). |
| `UseLocalVLMForScreenContext` | `true` | `false` to skip the VLM call and send the raw transcript to the planner. |
| `LocalVLMBaseURL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | OpenAI-compatible root for the local VLM |
| `LocalVLMModelIdentifier` | `ui-venus-1.5-2b` | Must match the model name loaded in LM Studio. 2B GUI specialist; the OCR layer fills in text fidelity the smaller model would miss. |
| `AlwaysRunLocalVLMRegardlessOfTranscript` | `false` | `true` → bypass the VLM-skip heuristic, run VLM on every turn |
| `LocalPlannerBaseURL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | OpenAI-compatible root for the local reasoner |
| `LocalPlannerModelIdentifier` | `qwen/qwen3-14b` | Must match the model name loaded in LM Studio for the planner role. Dense 14B is the default; swap up to `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b` or `gpt-oss-20b` when you have RAM, down to `qwen3-4b-instruct` when you don't. |
| `EnableActions` | `false` | `true` → action tags from the planner (`[CLICK:...]`, `[TYPE:...]`, etc.) are executed via AX-then-CGEvent |
| `AgentMaxSteps` | `8` | Per-task ceiling for the plan-act-observe loop. `1` disables multi-step (loop exits after first response). |
| `PushToTalkShortcut` | `controlOption` | One of `controlOption`, `shiftFunction`, `shiftControl`, `controlOptionSpace`, `shiftControlSpace`. Swap if another global dictation tool (e.g. Wispr Flow) is on the same key. |

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Menu Bar Panel Pattern**: The companion panel uses `NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon and a custom borderless `NSPanel` for the floating control panel. This gives full control over appearance (dark, rounded corners, custom shadow) and avoids the standard macOS menu/popover chrome. The panel is non-activating so it doesn't steal focus. A global event monitor auto-dismisses it on outside clicks.

**Cursor Overlay**: A full-screen transparent `NSPanel` hosts the blue cursor companion. It's non-activating, joins all Spaces, and never steals focus. The cursor position, response text, waveform, and pointing animations all render in this overlay via SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`.

**Global Push-To-Talk Shortcut**: Background push-to-talk uses a listen-only `CGEvent` tap instead of an AppKit global monitor so modifier-based shortcuts like `ctrl + option` are detected more reliably while the app is running in the background.

**Transient Cursor Mode**: When "Show Pace" is off, pressing the hotkey fades in the cursor overlay for the duration of the interaction (recording → response → TTS → optional pointing), then fades it out automatically after 1 second of inactivity.

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `leanring_buddyApp.swift` | ~89 | Menu bar app entry point. Uses `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` with `CompanionAppDelegate` which creates `MenuBarPanelManager` and starts `CompanionManager`. No main window — the app lives entirely in the status bar. |
| `CompanionManager.swift` | ~1290 | Central state machine. Owns dictation, shortcut monitoring, screen capture, the active `BuddyPlannerClient`, the active `BuddyTTSClient`, the `LocalVLMClient`, the `PaceActionExecutor`, the `PaceVisionOCRClient`, the screen-context pre-warm task, the per-screen analysis cache, and overlay management. Tracks voice state (idle/listening/processing/responding), conversation history, and cursor visibility. Coordinates the full push-to-talk → screenshot → (optional local VLM + OCR) → local planner → streaming TTS → (optional action execution) → pointing pipeline. **Still oversized** — the agent loop body (~250 lines) and the screen-context service (~300 lines) are the next two splits. |
| `CompanionSystemPrompt.swift` | ~85 | The 60+ line system prompt sent to the local planner on every turn. Extracted to its own file because it's a behavior contract — small wording changes here change end-to-end behavior, so it deserves its own diff-able artifact. Must stay byte-stable across turns for prompt-cache hits. |
| `PaceTagParsers.swift` | ~175 | Pure isolation-free parsers for the inline tag dialect the planner emits: `[POINT:x,y]`, `[DONE]`, the `transcriptIsLikelyScreenReferential` keyword heuristic, and `readMaxAgentStepCount`. Extracted from `CompanionManager` so each parser is unit-testable in isolation. The `PointingParseResult` struct also lives here. |
| `PaceUserPreferencesStore.swift` | ~60 | Typed key namespace + load/save helpers for boolean user preferences (`useLocalVLMForScreenContext`, `isWalkingAvatarEnabled`, `isPaceCursorEnabled`). Replaces three hand-rolled `UserDefaults` patterns with stringly-typed keys. `@Published` properties still live on `CompanionManager`; this owns only the storage layer. |
| `PaceCursorShape.swift` | ~50 | `CodexArrowShape` — the SwiftUI `Shape` Pace renders as its on-screen cursor. Extracted from `OverlayWindow.swift` so the shape can be reused without dragging the whole overlay machinery along. |
| `PaceOverlayPillViews.swift` | ~155 | `WhisperFlowVoicePillView` (glassmorphic audio-reactive capsule shown while user holds PTT) and `BlueCursorSpinnerView` (angular spinner shown while the AI is thinking). Both pulled out of `OverlayWindow.swift`. |
| `DesignSystemButtonStyles.swift` | ~480 | The seven `DS*ButtonStyle` conformers (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary / Text / Outlined / Destructive / Icon). Pulled out of `DesignSystem.swift` so the tokens-and-namespace file stays focused. All styles share three rules — pointer cursor on hover, 0.97 scale on press, state colours from `DS.Colors`. |
| `MenuBarPanelManager.swift` | ~243 | NSStatusItem + custom NSPanel lifecycle. Creates the menu bar icon, manages the floating companion panel (show/hide/position), installs click-outside-to-dismiss monitor. |
| `CompanionPanelView.swift` | ~761 | SwiftUI panel content for the menu bar dropdown. Shows companion status, push-to-talk instructions, model picker (Sonnet/Opus), permissions UI, DM feedback button, and quit button. Dark aesthetic using `DS` design system. |
| `OverlayWindow.swift` | ~730 | Full-screen transparent overlay hosting the blue cursor, response text, waveform, and spinner. Handles cursor animation, element pointing with bezier arcs, multi-monitor coordinate mapping, and fade-out transitions. (Shape and pill subviews live in `PaceCursorShape.swift` and `PaceOverlayPillViews.swift`.) |
| `CompanionResponseOverlay.swift` | ~217 | SwiftUI view for the response text bubble and waveform displayed next to the cursor in the overlay. |
| `CompanionScreenCaptureUtility.swift` | ~132 | Multi-monitor screenshot capture using ScreenCaptureKit. Returns labeled image data for each connected display. |
| `PacePushToTalkManager.swift` | ~899 | Push-to-talk voice pipeline (previously `BuddyDictationManager`). Handles microphone capture via `AVAudioEngine`, provider-aware permission checks, keyboard/button dictation sessions, transcript finalization, shortcut parsing, contextual keyterms, and live audio-level reporting for waveform feedback. |
| `BuddyTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~80 | Protocol surface and provider factory for voice transcription backends. Two cases: `apple` (default) → `AppleSpeechTranscriptionProvider`, `whisperkit` → `WhisperKitTranscriptionProvider`. Unknown / missing keys fall through to Apple Speech. |
| `AppleSpeechTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~147 | Default on-device transcription provider backed by Apple's Speech framework (`SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition=true`). |
| `WhisperKitTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~270 | Opt-in on-device transcription via WhisperKit (CoreML/ANE). Buffers PCM16 audio during push-to-talk, converts to Float samples, runs Whisper inference locally on release. Shares one model host across sessions to keep the model warm. Gated by `#if canImport(WhisperKit)` so the build succeeds without the SPM dep. |
| `BuddyAudioConversionSupport.swift` | ~108 | Audio conversion helpers. Converts live mic buffers to PCM16 mono audio and builds WAV payloads for upload-based providers. |
| `GlobalPushToTalkShortcutMonitor.swift` | ~132 | System-wide push-to-talk monitor. Owns the listen-only `CGEvent` tap and publishes press/release transitions. |
| `LocalVLMClient.swift` | ~280 | OpenAI-compatible HTTP client for a local vision-language model (LM Studio by default at `http://localhost:1234/v1`). Sends one screenshot + structured prompt, parses a `LocalVLMScreenAnalysis` (description + element list with bboxes, roles, text). Falls back to regex JSON extraction when the model strays from strict JSON. |
| `PaceVisionOCRClient.swift` | ~210 | Apple Vision `VNRecognizeTextRequest` wrapper. Returns `[RecognizedTextBox]` in screenshot pixel space. `PaceScreenContextMerger.enrich` fuses VLM elements with OCR text by bbox overlap (>50%), appending up to 30 orphan OCR boxes as `static_text` elements. Lets the 2B VLM stay fast while the OCR layer guarantees verbatim text fidelity. |
| `BuddyPlannerClient.swift` | ~55 | Protocol the active planner conforms to (`generateResponseStreaming`, `displayName`, `supportsImageInput`) + factory that returns the configured planner. Today only `LocalPlannerClient` conforms; a `ClaudeAPI` conformer was removed when the project committed to no-cloud-LLM. |
| `LocalPlannerClient.swift` | ~230 | Text-only OpenAI-compatible chat-completions client for a local reasoner. SSE streaming, parses `choices[0].delta.content`. Discards images (logs a notice) — relies on upstream VLM element map being prepended to `userPrompt`. Defensive `stripThinkingBlocks` helper removes `<think>…</think>` from streamed content for thinking-mode models. |
| `BuddyTTSClient.swift` | ~30 | Protocol the active TTS conforms to (`speakText`, `isPlaying`, `stopPlayback`) + trivial factory returning `LocalTTSClient`. Protocol kept so a future on-device runtime (Kokoro/Piper-MLX) can plug in without touching `CompanionManager`. |
| `LocalTTSClient.swift` | ~125 | On-device TTS via `AVSpeechSynthesizer`. The sole `BuddyTTSClient` conformer. Auto-prefers Premium > Enhanced > Default English voices. Maintains its own `isCurrentlySpeakingOrPending` flag so the CompanionManager poll-loop sees playback as active from the moment `speak()` is invoked. Hops to MainActor inside the delegate callback. |
| `StreamingSentenceTTSPipeline.swift` | ~200 | Consumes planner streamed text and dispatches complete sentences to TTS as they arrive, instead of waiting for the full response. Cuts perceived time-to-first-spoken-word from ~3s to ~500ms. Strips `<think>` blocks + action tags + `[POINT]` before sentence segmentation. Owns `markIntentCommitted()` + TTFSW logging — called from `CompanionManager` at PTT-release. |
| `PaceTelemetryLog.swift` | ~50 | Single `os.Logger` (subsystem `com.pace.app`, category `metrics`) for performance metrics. Emits `TTFSW=NNNms` and `TTFT=NNNms` to the macOS unified log alongside the existing `print(…)` calls, so `scripts/benchmark_ttfsw.sh` can aggregate per-turn latency without scraping the Xcode console. |
| `PaceActionExecutor.swift` | ~385 | CGEvent mouse + keyboard synthesis layer with screenshot-pixel → CG-global coordinate conversion (mirrors the pointing logic in CompanionManager). Single-clicks try `PaceAXTargeter` first; falls back to CGEvent. Also defines `PaceActionTagParser` which extracts `[CLICK:x,y]`, `[DOUBLE_CLICK:x,y]`, `[TYPE:text]`, `[KEY:cmd+s]`, `[SCROLL:up:3]` from planner responses in source order. Action execution is gated by Info.plist `EnableActions` (default false). |
| `PaceAXTargeter.swift` | ~135 | Accessibility-tree pre-pass for single clicks. Given a CG global point, calls `AXUIElementCopyElementAtPosition`, climbs up to a pressable role (AXButton, AXLink, AXMenuItem, etc.), and fires `AXUIElementPerformAction(kAXPressAction)`. Returns false on miss so the executor falls back to CGEvent. |
| `PaceAvatarOverlay.swift` | ~340 | Small walking-character SwiftUI overlay in its own `NSPanel`. `PaceAvatarOverlayManager` owns lifecycle + position; `PaceAvatarWalkController` drives horizontal movement + idle pauses + mouth-open state based on `CompanionVoiceState`. Click triggers `paceAvatarTapped` which opens the menu-bar panel. |
| `ElementLocationDetector.swift` | ~335 | Detects UI element locations in screenshots for cursor pointing. |
| `DesignSystem.swift` | ~420 | Design system tokens — colors, corner radii, animations, state layers. All UI references `DS.Colors`, `DS.CornerRadius`, etc. Button styles split into `DesignSystemButtonStyles.swift`. |
| `PaceAnalytics.swift` | ~121 | PostHog analytics integration for usage tracking. |
| `WindowPositionManager.swift` | ~262 | Window placement logic, Screen Recording permission flow, and accessibility permission helpers. |
| `AppBundleConfiguration.swift` | ~28 | Runtime configuration reader for keys stored in the app bundle Info.plist. |
| `scripts/benchmark_ttfsw.sh` | ~140 | Aggregates per-turn TTFSW + TTFT samples from the macOS unified log. Three modes: `--last 10m` (default 30m), `--live` (stream until Ctrl-C), `--file path` (parse a saved log). Outputs a markdown stats table — paste into PRs / landing page. |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj

# Select the leanring-buddy scheme, set signing team, Cmd+R to build and run

# Known non-blocking warnings: Swift 6 concurrency warnings,
# deprecated onChange warning in OverlayWindow.swift. Do NOT attempt to fix these.
```

**Do NOT run `xcodebuild` from the terminal** — it invalidates TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions and the app will need to re-request screen recording, accessibility, etc.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Variable and Method Naming

IMPORTANT: Follow these naming rules strictly. Clarity is the top priority.

- Be as clear and specific with variable and method names as possible
- **Optimize for clarity over concision.** A developer with zero context on the codebase should immediately understand what a variable or method does just from reading its name
- Use longer names when it improves clarity. Do NOT use single-character variable names
- Example: use `originalQuestionLastAnsweredDate` instead of `originalAnswered`
- When passing props or arguments to functions, keep the same names as the original variable. Do not shorten or abbreviate parameter names. If you have `currentCardData`, pass it as `currentCardData`, not `card` or `cardData`

### Code Clarity

- **Clear is better than clever.** Do not write functionality in fewer lines if it makes the code harder to understand
- Write more lines of code if additional lines improve readability and comprehension
- Make things so clear that someone with zero context would completely understand the variable names, method names, what things do, and why they exist
- When a variable or method name alone cannot fully explain something, add a comment explaining what is happening and why

### Swift/SwiftUI Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for all UI unless a feature is only supported in AppKit (e.g., `NSPanel` for floating windows)
- All UI state updates must be on `@MainActor`
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what", especially for non-obvious AppKit bridging
- AppKit `NSPanel`/`NSWindow` bridged into SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`
- All buttons must show a pointer cursor on hover
- For any interactive element, explicitly think through its hover behavior (cursor, visual feedback, and whether hover should communicate clickability)

### Do NOT

- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change
- Do not try to fix the known non-blocking warnings (Swift 6 concurrency, deprecated onChange)
- Do not rename the project directory or scheme (the "leanring" typo is intentional/legacy)
- Do not run `xcodebuild` from the terminal — it invalidates TCC permissions

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise, explain the "why" not the "what"
- Do not force-push to main
